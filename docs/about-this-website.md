I created this website for the purpose of storing my past courses data and share the knowledge to whomever visits. There would be tutorials and assignment archives to be found here. Attribution to contributors on the making of said tutorials are assured. Official resources are also acknowledged and given credit where credit is due.

Every assignment solution in the archives is my own interpretation of the solving method. It does not guarantee the efficiency of the solution. However, I tried to follow best practices and implement it in my codes.

I hope this repository of knowledge would be of help to you. Happy reading!
